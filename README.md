## Reason
HyperbolicTimeChamber is a simple productivity app based on the idea that tracking the time one spends working on one's projects and goals is one of the best ways to stay productive in the long run. It can be seen as the opposite of techniques such as the "Pomodoro Technique", which focus on short term productivity, and a response to complex productivity apps, which focus on micro-managing every aspect of a project or personal goal.

## Description
Projects can be created where productivity sessions may be added. Session duration, session description, session quality, and session start and end times are recorded in a session. Each project tracks its number of sessions and the total amount of time. A chronometer is used to track the session time. 

## Challenges
In building this app we encountered three major challenges.
1. Keeping a "Demo Project" in local storage while keeping all created projects in a database. This made the frontend logic a lot more   
   complex than initially expected.
3. Intercomponent Communication. For each major user action, events have to travel through several components and services, this also 
   proved to be more difficult than initially expected. 
5. Saving the state of each project (expanded or collapsed), as each user action from logging in, to adding and deleting session, to  
   creating or deleting a project, and even page reload required a slightly different implementation.

## Solutions
1. Two services were created in the frontend to keep the data, one for the Demo Project and one for all projects (including both the Demo
   Project and projects stored in the database). This made Demo Project, which had to be linked to the project stored in local storage 
   more managable.
2. Use of Angular Observables from Angular RxJS, specifically BehaviorSubject<<boolean>>, which were kept in services, and to which 
   components subscribe upon component initiation turned out to be a simple and "clean" solution to the problem of Intercomponent  
   Communication.
3. A "brute force" solution was implemented to solve this problem. We used boolean variables to indicate which type of user action to 
   handle, and using if statements we created a slightly different implementation for each. This is might not the cleanest solution, but    we were relieved that in the end it worked: 
  
  ```getAllProjects(user: User) {
    this.projectsService.getAllProjects(user).subscribe(
      (projects: Project[]) => {
        if (this.authenticationService.isUserLoggedIn() && this.dbProjects.length === 1) {
          // first check if it is an update
          if (this.checkProjectExpanded) {
            // update the state of the project [expanded or not]
            // case project deletion - set hideSession to last state;
            if (this.handleProjectDeletion) {
              for (let i = 0; i < projects.length; i++) {
                projects[i].hideSession = this.projectsExpandedState[i + 1];
                this.dbProjects.push(projects[i]);
              }
              this.handleProjectDeletion = false;

            // case creation or deletion of session - set hideSession to last state;
            } else if (this.handleNewSession) {
              for (let i = 0; i < projects.length; i++) {
                projects[i].hideSession = this.projectsExpandedState[i + 1];
                this.dbProjects.push(projects[i]);
              }
              this.handleNewSession = false;

            // case new project - set new project's hideSession to true
            } else {
              for (let i = 0; i < projects.length; i++) {
                if (i === projects.length - 1) {
                  projects[i].hideSession = true;
                  this.dbProjects.push(projects[i]);
                } else {
                  projects[i].hideSession = this.projectsExpandedState[i + 1];
                  this.dbProjects.push(projects[i]);
                }
              }
            }

            this.checkProjectExpanded = false;
          // else case is triggered when logging in;
          } else {
            projects.forEach(p => {
              p.hideSession = true;
              this.dbProjects.push(p)
            });
          }
        }
      },
      (error: HttpErrorResponse) => {
        console.log(error);
      },
      () => {
        this.onDbProjectsUpdated(true);
      }
    );
  }
